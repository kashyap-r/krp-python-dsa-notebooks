    "### Dynamic Programming Defined\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming amounts to breaking down an optimization problem into simpler sub-problems, and storing the solution to each sub-problem so that each sub-problem is only solved once.\n",
    "\n",
    "DP is a useful technique for optimization problems, those problems that seek the maximum or minimum solution given certain constraints, because it looks through all possible sub-problems and never recomputes the solution to any sub-problem. This guarantees correctness and efficiency, which we cannot say of most techniques used to solve or approximate algorithms. This alone makes DP special.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sub-problems on Sub-problems on Sub-problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-problems are smaller versions of the original problem. In fact, sub-problems often look like a reworded version of the original problem. If formulated correctly, sub-problems build on each other in order to obtain the solution to the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a better idea of how this works, let’s find the sub-problem in an example dynamic programming problem.\n",
