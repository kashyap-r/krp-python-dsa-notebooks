    "    How to Handle:\n",
    "        Treat the unary operator as part of the operand during parsing.\n",
    "        For instance, parse -A as a single operand.\n",

    "6. Operators with Different Associativity\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: A ^ B ^ C\n",
    "        Exponentiation (^) is right-to-left associative.\n",

    "8. Division by Zero or Undefined Modulus\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: A/0+BA/0+B or AA\n",
    "        Division or modulus by zero is mathematically undefined.\n",
    "    How to Handle:\n",
    "        This isn't a problem during conversion but should be flagged during evaluation.\n",

    "9. Logical Operators with Non-Boolean Values\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: A && B + C\n",
    "        Logical operators like &&, || are typically used with boolean values, but operands may be non-boolean.\n",
    "    How to Handle:\n",
    "        Ensure logical operators are paired with appropriate boolean-compatible operands.\n",
    "\n",

    "12. Redundant Parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: ((A+B))((A+B))\n",
    "        Extra parentheses don't change the meaning but can complicate parsing.\n",
    "    How to Handle:\n",
    "        The algorithm should handle redundant parentheses gracefully and not alter correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Mixed Types of Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: A + B && C * D\n",
    "        Mixing logical (&&) and arithmetic (+, *) operators requires careful handling of precedence.\n",

    "\n",
    "15. Custom Symbols or Undefined Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: A $ B & C @ D\n",
    "        Custom operators must have explicitly defined precedence and associativity.\n",
    "    How to Handle:\n",
    "        Validate the expression against the precedence table and raise errors for undefined symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Repeated Parentheses or Operators\n",
