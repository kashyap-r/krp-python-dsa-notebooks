    "Given a sorted array of size n and an element to be searched in it. Return index of x if it is present in array else return -1 \n",

    "Fibonacci Search is a comparison based search technique that uses Fibonacci numbers tp search an element in an array \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarities with Binary Search\n",
    "1. Works for Sorted arrays\n",
    "2. A didide and conquer algorithm\n",
    "3. Has Log n time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences with Binary Search \n",
    "1. Fibonacci Search divides given array into unequal parts\n",
    "2. Binary Search uses a division operator to divide range. Fibonacci Search doesn't use /, but uses + and -. The division operator may be costly on some CPUs\n",
    "3. Fibonacci Search examines relatively closer elements in subsequent steps. So when the input array is big that cannot fit in CPU cache or even in RAM, Fibonacci Search can be useful.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "Fibonacci Numbers are recursively defined as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1. First few Fibonacci Numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …\n",
    "Observations: \n",
    "Below observation is used for range elimination, and hence for the O(log(n)) complexity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "F(n-2) = (1/3) * F(n)\n",
    "F(n-1) = (2/3)*F(n)\n",
