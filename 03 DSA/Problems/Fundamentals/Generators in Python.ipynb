    "\n",
    "In Python, yield keyword is used to create generators, which are special types of iterators that allow values to be produced lazily, one at a time, instead of returning them all at once. This makes yield particularly useful for handling large datasets efficiently, as it allows iteration without storing entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example: Think of yield like a vending machine. Each time you press a button (call next()), it gives you one item and pauses. It remembers where it left off, so next time you press the button, it continues from there instead of starting over. This continues until all items are dispensed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Do We Need yield Keyword?\n",
    "Supports Infinite Sequences: Lets you define generators that can yield an endless stream of values (e.g., Fibonacci series, real-time data).\n",
    "Enables Coroutine-like Behavior: Useful in asynchronous programming where a function needs to pause and resume later.\n",
    "Improves Testability: Makes functions easier to test by breaking execution into predictable steps.\n",
    "Builds Modular Pipelines: Encourages cleaner architecture by separating data production and consumption stages.\n",
    "Fine-Grained Control Over Iteration: Lets you customize exactly when and how values are produced, offering more flexibility than regular functions.\n",
