    "### Binary Tree \n",
    "Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack, and queues, which are linear data structures, **trees are hierarchical data structures.** \n",
    "\n",
    "A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. It is implemented mainly using Links. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary Tree Representation:\n",
    "A tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL. \n",
    "A Binary Tree node contains the following parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Data \n",
    "    2. Pointer to left child \n",
    "    3. Pointer to the right child \n",
    "    \n",
    "A Binary Tree can be traversed in two ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Depth First Traversal: \n",
    "        Inorder (Left-Root-Right), \n",
    "        Preorder (Root-Left-Right), and \n",
    "        Postorder (Left-Right-Root) \n",
    "\n",
    "    Breadth-First Traversal: Level Order Traversal\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Binary Tree Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ = 2l.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Maximum number of nodes = 2h + 1 – 1.\n",
    "    Here h is height of a tree. Height is considered \n",
    "    as the maximum number of edges on a path from root to leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Minimum possible height =  ceil(Log2(n+1)) - 1  \n",
    "\n",
    "    In Binary tree, number of leaf nodes is always one \n",
    "    more than nodes with two children.\n",

    "    Searching for an element.\n",

    "**Applications of Binary Tree:**\n",
    "    Huffman coding trees are used in data compression algorithms.\n",
    "    Priority Queue is another application of binary tree that is used for searching maximum or minimum in O(logn) time complexity.\n",
    "    In compilers, Expression Trees are used which is an application of binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary Tree Traversals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Preorder Traversal: Here, the traversal is : root – left child – right child. \n",
    "    It means that the root node is traversed first then its left child and finally the right child.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Inorder Traversal: Here, the traversal is : left child – root – right child. \n",
    "    It means that the left child is traversed first then its root node and finally the right child.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Postorder Traversal: Here, the traversal is : left child – right child – root.  \n",
    "    It means that the left child is traversed first then the right child and finally its root node.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Examples: One reason to use binary trees or trees, in general, is for the things that form a hierarchy. \n",
    "They are useful in File structures where each file is located in a particular directory and there is a specific hierarchy \n",
    "associated with files and directories. Another example where Trees are useful is storing hierarchical objects like \n",
