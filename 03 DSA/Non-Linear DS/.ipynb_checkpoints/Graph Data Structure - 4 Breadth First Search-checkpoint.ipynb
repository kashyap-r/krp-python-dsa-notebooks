    "### Breadth First Search or BFS for a Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. It begins with a node, then first traverses all its adjacent nodes. Once all adjacent are visited, then their adjacent are traversed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uses: BFS itself can be used to detect cycle in a directed and undirected graph, find shortest path in an unweighted graph and many more problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BFS from a Given Source:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts from a given source and explores all reachable vertices from the given source. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the given source (in tree we begin with the root), we traverse the vertices level by level using a queue data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only catch here is that, unike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid this, we use a boolean \"visited\" array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:** Enqueue the given source vertex into a queue and mark it visited. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exploration: While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "   * Dequeue a node from the queue and visit it i.e. print its value\n",
    "   * For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node:\n",
    "       - enqueue the neighbor into the queue\n",
    "       - mark the neighbor as visited\n",
    "2. Termination: Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm ensures that all nodes in the graph are visited in a breadth-first manner, starting from the starting node.\n"
