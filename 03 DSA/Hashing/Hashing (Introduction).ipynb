    "### Hashing | Set 1 (Introduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to design a system for storing employee records with phone numbers(as keys). And we want the following queries to be performed efficiently: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Insert a phone number and corresponding information.\n",
    "    Search a phone number and fetch the information.\n",
    "    Delete a phone number and related information.\n",
    "We can think of using the following data structures to maintain information about different phone numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Array of phone numbers and records.\n",
    "    2. Linked List of phone numbers and records.\n",
    "    3. Balanced binary search tree with phone numbers as keys.\n",
    "    4. Direct Access Table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For **arrays and linked lists**, we need to search in a linear fashion, which can be costly in practice. If we use arrays and keep the data sorted, then a phone number can be searched in O(Logn) time using Binary Search, but insert and delete operations become costly as we have to maintain sorted order. \n",
    "\n",
    "With **balanced binary search tree**, we get moderate search, insert and delete times. All of these operations can be guaranteed to be in O(Logn) time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another solution that one can think of is to use a **direct access table** where we make a big array and use phone numbers as index in the array. An entry in array is NIL if phone number is not present, else the array entry stores pointer to records corresponding to phone number. Time complexity wise this solution is the best among all, we can do all operations in O(1) time. For example to insert a phone number, we create a record with details of given phone number, use phone number as index and store the pointer to the created record in table. \n",
    "This solution has many practical limitations. First problem with this solution is extra space required is huge. For example if phone number is n digits, we need O(m * 10n) space for table where m is size of a pointer to record. Another problem is an integer in a programming language may not store n digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to above limitations Direct Access Table cannot always be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hashing** is the solution that can be used in almost all such situations and performs extremely well compared to above data structures like Array, Linked List, Balanced BST in practice. With hashing we get O(1) search time on average (under reasonable assumptions) and O(n) in worst case.  Now let us understand what hashing is."

    "HashMap - Best Practices and Common Mistakes \n",
    "1. Keys must be immutable - if the content of the key changes, the hash function will return differnt hash, python wont be able to find the value associated with the key. \n",
    "2. Addressing hashmap collisions -\n",
    "       Hashing only works if each item maps to a unique location in the hash table. But sometimes, hash functions can return the same output for different inputs.\n",
    "       For example, if you’re using a division hash function, different integers may have the same hash function (they may return the same remainder when applying the module division), thereby creating a problem called collision.\n",
    "       Collisions must be resolved, and several techniques exist. Luckily, in the case of dictionaries, Python handles potential collisions under the hood.\n",
    "4. Understanding load factor - The load factor is defined as the ratio of the number of elements in the table to the total number of buckets. It’s a measure to estimate how well-distributed the data is. As a rule of thumb, the more evenly the data is distributed, the less likelihood of collisions.\n",
    "5. Be aware of performance - A good hash function would minimize the number of collisions, be easy to compute, and evenly distribute the items in the hash table. This could be done by increasing the table size or the complexity of the hash function. Although this is practical for small numbers of items, it is not feasible when the number of possible items is large, as it would result in memory-consuming, less efficient hashmaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are dictionaries what you need?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dictionaries are great, but other data structures may be more suitable for your specific data and needs. In the end, dictionaries do not support common operations, such as indexing, slicing, and concatenation, making them less flexible and more difficult to work with in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Python Hashmap Implementations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see some of the most popular examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defaultdict** - Every time you try to access a key that is not present in your dictionary, Python will return a KeyError. A way to prevent this is by searching for information using the .get() method. However, an optimized way to do that is by using Defaultdict, available in the module collections. Defaultdict and dictionaries are almost the same. The sole difference is that Defaultdict never raises an error because it provides a default value for non-existent keys.\n",
