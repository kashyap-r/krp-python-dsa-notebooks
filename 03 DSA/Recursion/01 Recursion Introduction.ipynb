    "## Recursion \n",
    "\n",
    "The term Recursion can be defined as the process of defining something in terms of itself. In simple words, it is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of using recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A complicated function can be split down into smaller sub-problems utilizing recursion.\n",
    "2. Sequence creation is simpler through recursion than utilizing any nested iteration.\n",
    "3. Recursive functions render the code look simple and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of using recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A lot of memory and time is taken through recursive calls which makes it expensive for use.\n",
    "2. Recursive functions are challenging to debug.\n",
    "3. The reasoning behind recursion can sometimes be tough to think through.\n",

    "#### What is Recursion? \n",

    "The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Need of Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is an amazing technique with the help of which we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write.  A task that can be defined with its similar subtask, recursion is one of the best solutions for it. For example; The Factorial of a number.\n",

    "### A Mathematical Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider a problem that a programmer has to determine the sum of first n natural numbers, there are several ways of doing that but the simplest approach is simply to add the numbers starting from 1 to n. So the function simply looks like this,\n",
    "\n",
    "approach(1) – Simply adding one by one\n",

    "f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 +……..+ n\n",

    "\n",
    "#### How are recursive functions stored in memory?\n",
    "\n",
