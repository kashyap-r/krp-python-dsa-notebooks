    "**Sorting** is the operation of arranging the records of a table into some sequetial order according to an ordering criterion. The  sort is performed according to the key value of each record. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Sorting Terminology:**\n",
    "**In-place Sorting:** An in-place sorting algorithm uses constant space for producing the output (modifies the given array only) or copying elements to a temporary storage. \n",
    "Examples: **Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Heap Sort.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal Sorting:** Internal Sorting is when all the data is placed in the main memory or internal memory. In internal sorting, the problem cannot take input beyond its size.\n",
    "**Example: heap sort, bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort, shell sort, insertion sort.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**External Sorting:** External Sorting is when all the data that needs to be sorted cannot be placed in memory at a time, the sorting is called external sorting. External Sorting is used for the massive amount of data. \n",
    "**Examples: Merge sort, Tag sort, Polyphase sort, Four tape sort, External radix sort, etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stable sorting:** When two same items appear in the same order in sorted data as in the original array called stable sort. \n",
    "**Examples: Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unstable sorting:** When two same data appear in the different order in sorted data it is called unstable sort. \n",
    "**Examples: Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Shell Sort.**"
