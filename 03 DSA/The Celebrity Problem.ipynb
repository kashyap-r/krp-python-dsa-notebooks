    "2. Verify Potential celebrity\n",
    "    - Check if a candidate is a celebrity\n",
    "       - The candidate should not know anyone (i.e. all entries in their row except diagonal element should be Zero)\n",
    "       - Everyone should know the celebrity (i.e. all entries in their column should be one, except for the diagonal element)\n",
    "          \n",
    "3. If both conditions are satisfied, then return the index of celebrity, otherwise returh -1\n",
