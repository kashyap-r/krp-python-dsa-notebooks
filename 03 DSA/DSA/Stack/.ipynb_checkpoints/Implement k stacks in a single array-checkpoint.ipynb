    "We have discussed space-efficient implementation of 2 stacks in a single array.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, a general solution for k stacks is discussed. Following is the detailed problem statement. Create a data structure kStacks that represents k stacks. Implementation of kStacks should use only one array, i.e., k stacks should use the same array for storing elements. \n",

    "The following functions must be supported by k Stacks. push(int x, int sn) –> pushes x to stack number ‘sn’ where sn is from 0 to k-1 pop(int sn) –> pops an element from stack number ‘sn’ where sn is from 0 to k-1 \n"
