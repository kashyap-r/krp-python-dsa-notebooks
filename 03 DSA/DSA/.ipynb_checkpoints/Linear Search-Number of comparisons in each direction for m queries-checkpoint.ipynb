    "\n",
    "Given an array containing N distinct elements. There are M queries, each containing an integer X and asking for the index of X in the array. For each query, the task is to perform linear search X from left to right and count the number of comparisons it took to find X and do the same thing right to left. In the end, print the total number of comparisons in both directions among all the queries\n",
