    "### Linear Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks. Below is an overview of some popular linear data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Array \n",
    "2. Linked List \n",
    "3. Stack \n",
    "4. Queue \n",
    "\n",
    "### Array \n",
    "\n",
    "The array is a data structure used to store homogeneous elements at contiguous locations. The size of an array must be provided before storing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let size of array be n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Time:    O(1) [This is possible because elements are stored at contiguous locations]  \n",
    "\n",
    "Search Time   :    O(n) for Sequential Search: \n",
    "                   O(log n) for Binary Search [If Array is sorted]\n",
    "                   \n",
    "Insertion Time:    O(n) [The worst case occurs when insertion happens at the Beginning of an array and requires shifting\n",
    "                        all of the elements]\n",
    "                        \n",

    "Example: For example, let us say, we want to store marks of all students in a class, we can use an array to store them. This helps in reducing the use of a number of variables as we don’t need to create a separate variable for marks of every subject. All marks can be accessed by simply traversing the array. \n"

    "### Linked List \n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a linear data structure (like arrays) where each element is a separate object. \n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is made up of two items that are data and a reference to the next node. A reference to the next node is given\n",
    "with the help of pointers and data is the value of a node. Each node contains data and links to the other nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is an ordered collection of data elements called a node and the linear order is maintained by pointers. It has an upper\n",
    "hand over the array as the number of nodes i.e. the size of the linked list is not fixed and can grow and shrink as and \n",
    "when required, unlike arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Linked List : \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Singly Linked List:** In this type of linked list, every node stores address or reference of the next node in the list and the last node has the next address or reference as NULL. For example 1->2->3->4->NULL \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Doubly Linked List:** In this type of Linked list, there are two references associated with each node, One of the \n",
    "reference points to the next node and one to the previous node. The advantage of this data structure is that we can \n",
    "traverse in both directions and for deletion, we don’t need to have explicit access to the previous node. \n",
    "Eg. NULL<-1<->2<->3->NULL \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Circular Linked List:** Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. \n",
    "There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or a doubly circular linked list. \n",
    "The advantage of this data structure is that any node can be made as starting node. This is useful in the implementation of \n",
    "the circular queues in the linked list. \n",
    "Eg. 1->2->3->1 [The next pointer of the last node is pointing to the first] \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Circular Doubly Linked List:** The circular doubly linked list is a combination of the doubly linked list and the \n",
    "circular linked list. It means that this linked list is bidirectional and contains two pointers and the last pointer points \n",
    "to the first pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing time of an element : O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Search time of an element : O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion of an Element : O(1) [If we are at the position where we have to insert an element] \n",
    "\n",
    "Deletion of an Element : O(1) [If we know address of node previous to the node to be deleted] \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider the previous example where we made an array of marks of students. \n",
    "Now if a new subject is added to the course, its marks are also to be added to the array of marks. But the size of the \n",
    "array was fixed and it is already full so it can not add any new element. If we make an array of a size lot more than the \n",
    "number of subjects it is possible that most of the array will remain empty. We reduce the space wastage Linked List is \n",
    "formed which adds a node only when a new element is introduced. Insertions and deletions also become easier with a linked \n",
    "list. \n",
    "One big drawback of a linked list is, random access is not allowed. With arrays, we can access i’th element in O(1) time. \n",
    "In the linked list, it takes Θ(i) time. "

    "that the memory is utilized in a better way. This is because if there is an empty space i.e. if no element is present at a \n",
    "certain position in the queue, then an element can be easily added at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority Queue: This queue is a special type of queue. Its specialty is that it arranges the elements in a queue based on \n",
    "some priority. The priority can be something where the element with the highest value has the priority so it creates a \n",
    "queue with decreasing order of values. The priority can also be such that the element with the lowest value gets the \n",
    "highest priority so in turn it creates a queue with increasing order of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dequeue: Dequeue is also known as Double Ended Queue. As the name suggests double ended, it means that an element can be \n",
    "inserted or removed from both the ends of the queue unlike the other queues in which it can be done only from one end. \n",
