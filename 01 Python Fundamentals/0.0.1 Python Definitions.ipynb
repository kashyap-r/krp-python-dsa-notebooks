    "\n",
    "    Python lists do the work of most of the collection data structures found in other languages and since they are built-in, you don’t have to worry about manually creating them.\n",
    "    Lists can be used for any type of object, from numbers and strings to more lists.\n",
    "    They are accessed just like strings (e.g. slicing and concatenation) so they are simple to use and they’re variable length, i.e. they grow and shrink automatically as they’re used.\n",
    "    In reality, Python lists are C arrays inside the Python interpreter and act just like an array of pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionary:**\n",
    " In python, dictionary is similar to hash or maps in other languages. It consists of key value pairs. The value can be accessed by unique key in the dictionary. \n",
    " \n",
    "    *Keys are unique & immutable objects.\n",

    "**Tuple :**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python tuples work exactly like Python lists except they are immutable, i.e. they can’t be \n",
    "changed in place. They are normally written inside parentheses to distinguish them from lists (which use square brackets), but as you’ll see, parentheses aren’t always necessary. Since tuples are immutable, their length is fixed. To grow or shrink a tuple, a new tuple must be created. "
