    "121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\n",
    "Easy \n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.\n",
    "Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation \n",
    "1. Input an array of stock prices\n",
    "2. The stock value should be at its minimum for a buy \n",
    "3. The stcok price have to be GT and max in future to be able to sell it\n",
    "\n",
    "So.. \n",
    "Step1: Find the minimum value in the arrray min\n",
    "Step2: Then, find the array element that is GT min and preferably MAX value in the remaining elements\n",

    "Input: array of stock prices\n",
    "Constraints: \n",
    "- Input has to be numerical (integer or decimal upto 2 decimal places)\n",
    "- Input array cannot have negative values \n",
    "- Input array cannot have Zeros \n",
