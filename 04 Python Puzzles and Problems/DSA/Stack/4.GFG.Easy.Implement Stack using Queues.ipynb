    "Given a Queue data structure that supports standard operations like enqueue() and dequeue(). The task is to implement a Stack data structure using Queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Stack can be implemented using two queues. Let Stack to be implemented be ‘s’ and queues used to implement are ‘q1’ and ‘q2’. Stack ‘s’ can be implemented in two ways:\n",

    "Implement Stack using Queues By making push() operation costly:\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the idea to solve the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to keep newly entered element at the front of ‘q1’ so that pop operation dequeues from ‘q1’. ‘q2’ is used to put every new element in front of ‘q1’."
