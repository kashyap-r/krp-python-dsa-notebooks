    "The tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. \n",

    "The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three poles and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any pole. The puzzle starts with the disk in a neat stack in ascending order of size in one pole, the smallest at the top thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move all the disks from one pole (say ‘source pole’) to another pole (say ‘destination pole’) with the help of the third pole (say auxiliary pole).\n",
    "\n",
    "The puzzle has the following two rules:\n",
    "      1. You can’t place a larger disk onto a smaller disk \n",
    "      2. Only one disk can be moved at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the number of moves required i.e. pow(2, n) - 1, where n is number of disks\n",
    "2. If number of disks is even, then interchange destination pole and auxiliary pole\n",
    "3. for i = 1 to total number of moves:\n",
    "       if i%3 == 1:\n",
    "           \n"
